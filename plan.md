1.	Objective: Build a client for the Anthropic MCP protocol that generates a memory knowledge graph.

2.	Review Existing Code:
	•	Examine the contents of the memoryhash_server_mcp_repo.txt and anthropic_mcp_ts_sdk_repo.txt files.
	•	Understand the code from first principles to fully grasp its functionality.
	•	Develop a detailed implementation plan for the client based on your review.

3.	Implementation:
	•	Implement the client in the memoryhash_server_mcp_repo.txt file, following the plan you created.
    
4.	Testing:
	•	Test the implemented client to verify it functions as intended.
